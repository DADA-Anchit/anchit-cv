            <p>Hello, I'm Anchit Gautam, a dedicated and aspiring student currently pursuing science with a focus on
                computer science
                at Xavier International College in Nepal. Passionate about the world of technology, I find joy in

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>My educational journey has been a colorful tapestry woven across various institutions. I embarked on my
                academic voyage
                at Boston International School, where the foundations of my education were laid from Nursery to Grade 2.
                Transitioning
                to Riviera International School for Grades 3 to 6, I continued to nurture my intellectual curiosity and
                passion for
                learning.</p>

            <p>The next chapter unfolded at Little Flower Secondary School, where I spent Grades 7 to 10 and
                successfully completed my
                Secondary Education Examination (SEE). It was a period of academic growth, personal development, and the
                forging of
                lasting connections. SEE marked a significant milestone, laying the groundwork for the next stage of my
                educational
                adventure.</p>

            <p>Currently, I find myself at Xavier International College in Nepal, pursuing science with a focus on
                computer science in
                Grade 11. Here, I have the opportunity to delve deeper into the world of technology, honing my skills in
                programming and
                web development.</p>
